 SEDA Hackathon Submission - App Progress Oracle
</h1>
üìù Project Goal:
The primary goal of this project was to build a custom Oracle program using the SEDA starter kit, designed to fetch and respond to data requests from the SEDA blockchain network.
Beyond just completing the oracle, I had a broader vision: integrating this oracle into an educational app I developed using Flutter/Dart. The app is designed to help users (especially in Nigeria and other developing countries) learn about a wide range of subjects‚Äîfrom university degree courses to cryptocurrency, cooking, forex trading, and more.
Coming from Nigeria, where economic challenges are real, I‚Äôm deeply passionate about helping people gain financial independence and knowledge-based empowerment.
For this SEDA hackathon, my first target was to build an oracle that fetches the current number of app users from Firebase using its REST API. The long-term plan is to extend this into fetching each user's course progress through SEDA, allowing us to provide blockchain-verified learning certifications.
‚úÖ What I Managed to Accomplish:
Downloaded and studied the SEDA starter project from GitHub.

Imported the project into VS Code for development.

Installed and configured Bun, Node.js, and Git Bash.

Installed and configured GNU Make for Windows.

Installed Rust and Cargo, and began setting up the WASM toolchain.

Created the necessary .env file from the provided template.

Developed the Flutter/Dart-based educational app backend and UI.

Integrated Firebase REST API calls for live user count fetching.

‚ùå Roadblocks Encountered:
Unfortunately, my development was severely slowed down by system-level restrictions on my Windows machine, especially:

installing make,bun (i'm used to using node.js)

Strict PowerShell execution policies preventing key installation scripts.

Challenges installing Bun initially due to policy and environment variables.

Difficulty setting up GNU Make and Rust/Cargo correctly within Git Bash and VS Code.

Repeated build failures due to missing Cargo and WASM build targets.

Spent several hours troubleshooting installation and build pipeline issues rather than focusing on the oracle logic.

‚úÖ Lessons Learned:
Gained hands-on experience with cross-platform toolchains (Bun, Rust, Make) under Windows.

Learned the build and deployment flow for CosmWasm-based smart contracts and Oracle programs on SEDA.

Deepened my understanding of Rust, WASM targets, and blockchain oracle mechanics.

Improved my skills in managing environment variables and system PATH configurations on Windows.

‚úÖ Next Steps (Post Hackathon):
Finish resolving Cargo build errors and WASM target setup.

Successfully build and deploy the Oracle to a SEDA testnet.

Complete the data request/response flow tests using the SEDA CLI and starter scripts.

Finalize the Firebase ‚Üí SEDA Oracle data flow.

Open-source the completed project for public use and future developer learning.

‚úÖ Summary:
Despite the roadblocks, this hackathon was a valuable learning experience.

While I couldn‚Äôt fully deploy the Oracle before the competition deadline, I gained substantial knowledge and built most of the project foundation.

I‚Äôm committed to completing this project, both for personal growth and to help empower others through accessible, blockchain-integrated education.

Thank you for the opportunity!
